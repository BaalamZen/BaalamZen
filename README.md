# 👋 Hi, I’m Ian (BaalamZen)

Automation builder • Creative technologist • SaaS sales leader  
Focused on AI workflows, Webflow/MCP integrations, n8n pipelines, and bilingual digital ecosystems for creators across LATAM + US.

I specialize in **practical, real-world automation**—the kind that removes friction, scales content, and connects tools that aren’t designed to talk to each other. My work lives at the intersection of:

- AI + content automation  
- Workflow engines (n8n, Claude MCP, custom scripts)  
- Webflow CMS + API orchestration  
- YouTube/TikTok publishing automation  
- Affiliate intelligence + structured data pipelines  
- Bilingual (EN/ES-MX) content ecosystems
